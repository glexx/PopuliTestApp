Its many quirky pubs and restaurants such as Nobles and Kings Wark make it worth a visit. The Water of Leith Walkway is a popular cycling and walking route and the many colourful boats and tree-lined walkways make it feel as though you've left the city. The walk takes you through some of the prettiest areas of Edinburgh such as Stockbridge and Dean Village."

On top of the hill you'll find the Nelson Monument and the National Monument, an unfinished acropolis that is better known under its local nickname 'Edinburgh's disgrace.' It may be seen as a failure in architectural endeavours but it is still a popular place to get some fantastic photos."

In fact, if you want to examine well preserved Roman ruins in peace and quiet with time to contemplate the ancient world, you'll be hard pressed to find better.\nTracing its roots back to at least the 4th century BC, Ostia Antica served as Rome's principle port for hundreds of years, a witness and monument to the rise of the ancient superpower, its dominance and eventual decline."

Beyond a shadow of a doubt, nothing represents the sheer power and magnificence of the Roman Empire like this stunning piece of ancient architecture.\nThe Colosseum, or 'Colosseo' in Italian, was once the largest amphitheatre in the Roman Empire. It was built in the first century AD by the Emperor Vespasian as a place for the people of Rome to enjoy. Originally named the Flavian Amphitheatre, after Vespasian's family name, the man who brought the Roman Empire back from the brink would not live to see its completion."

Dedicated to Saint Mary Nascent, this cathedral is the largest cathedral in Italy, and the fifth largest in the world. Construction of the cathedral began in 1386 and it was consecrated in 1418. However, it was not until 1965 that the finishing touches were applied to the building. This long construction period led to the use of various building styles, resulting in a masterpiece of architecture and art."

Despite a 21-year-long restoration process completed in 1999, the painting gives only hints of its original glory, yet its artistry is so great that viewing it is still a powerful and moving experience for many visitors. Only 25 visitors are allowed to view the masterpiece at a time, making reservations mandatory for the must-see masterpiece."

With its blue glass vaulted ceilings, mosaic flooring and towering central dome, the mall's architecture is as stunning as the high-end couture offered in its shops, which include Louis Vuitton, Borsalino and Prada. The shopping center's popularity as meeting place as earned the Galleria the nickname “il salotto di Milano,” or Milan's drawing room. Tradition has it that turning on one's heel over the mosaic bull under the central dome brings good luck."
