Its many quirky pubs and restaurants such as Nobles and Kings Wark make it worth a visit. The Water of Leith Walkway is a popular cycling and walking route and the many colourful boats and tree-lined walkways make it feel as though you've left the city. The walk takes you through some of the prettiest areas of Edinburgh such as Stockbridge and Dean Village."

On top of the hill you'll find the Nelson Monument and the National Monument, an unfinished acropolis that is better known under its local nickname 'Edinburgh's disgrace.' It may be seen as a failure in architectural endeavours but it is still a popular place to get some fantastic photos."

In fact, if you want to examine well preserved Roman ruins in peace and quiet with time to contemplate the ancient world, you'll be hard pressed to find better.\nTracing its roots back to at least the 4th century BC, Ostia Antica served as Rome's principle port for hundreds of years, a witness and monument to the rise of the ancient superpower, its dominance and eventual decline."

Beyond a shadow of a doubt, nothing represents the sheer power and magnificence of the Roman Empire like this stunning piece of ancient architecture.\nThe Colosseum, or 'Colosseo' in Italian, was once the largest amphitheatre in the Roman Empire. It was built in the first century AD by the Emperor Vespasian as a place for the people of Rome to enjoy. Originally named the Flavian Amphitheatre, after Vespasian's family name, the man who brought the Roman Empire back from the brink would not live to see its completion."
